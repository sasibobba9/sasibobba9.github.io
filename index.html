								<h2 class="major">AIM OF PROJECT</h2>
								<p>The aim of this project is to design and develop a bio-inspired robotic model of a manta ray that replicates the natural form and smooth fin movements of the real-life marine creature. The main objective is to combine nature-inspired design with modern engineering techniques to create both a functional robotic prototype and a smaller toy version of a manta ray.

As a group, we began this project by brainstorming ideas and researching various marine creatures. We finalised the manta ray concept because of its unique shape, elegant movement, and potential for creative mechanical design. We started developing sketches and explored different possibilities for creating a toy manta ray with movable fins.

To achieve accuracy in design, we used 3D scanning hardware and software to capture detailed anatomical features from existing manta ray models. Motion capture technology further helped us study and understand the natural fin movement, allowing us to replicate it in our design.

The design and modelling process was carried out using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software and 3D modelling tools. Haptic input devices and sculpting software enabled us to fine-tune the complex organic structure of the manta ray with better control and precision.

Finally, we used 3D printing technology and resin production to fabricate the parts and assemble the prototype. The toy version features articulated fins designed to move naturally, serving as both an educational tool and a demonstration of biomimicry and mechanical articulation.

This project demonstrates how nature can inspire innovative engineering solutions through advanced design, motion analysis, and modern fabrication techniques.</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="major">Development Process</h2>
  <ol>
	  
    <li>
      <strong>Research and Conceptualization:</strong><br>
The development of the bio-inspired manta ray model began with an in-depth research phase, where our group explored various marine creatures for inspiration. After multiple brainstorming sessions, we finalised the idea of designing a robotic manta ray because of its unique structure, elegant body design, and fluid fin movement.

We studied the biology, structure, and natural movement patterns of real manta rays, focusing on their body proportions, fin dynamics, and swimming style. This research gave us an understanding of how manta rays glide smoothly in water using their large, flexible pectoral fins.
We created multiple hand sketches and rough design ideas to visualise the overall shape of the manta ray and identify the possible articulation points for fin movement.    </li>
	  
    <li>
      <strong>3D Scanning and Reference Collection:</strong><br>
To make the design more accurate and realistic, we used 3D scanning hardware and software available in the university facilities. 
The main purpose of using 3D scanning was to capture the fine surface details, skin textures, and curves of existing fish models. This data was extremely useful in replicating the natural skin pattern and the organic flow of the manta ray’s body.

Along with 3D scanning, we referred to multiple reference images and 3D scanned data available online to study the anatomical structure of manta rays. 
The scanned texture details were later integrated into the digital design to give a realistic finish to the final 3D printed model.    </li>
	  
    <li>
      <strong>CAD Design and Modeling:</strong><br>
Once the research and data collection phase was completed, we moved on to the digital modelling process. Onshape, a cloud-based 3D modelling software, was used to create the manta ray model. The entire model was designed in multiple segments to ensure that the fins could move naturally when assembled.

Instead of traditional CAD software like Fusion 360, Onshape provided flexibility in creating and refining the model collaboratively. 
We focused on designing a hollow main body for lightweight construction, with segmented left and right pectoral fins that could simulate the flapping motion of a real manta ray.
Special attention was given to designing the fin sections, where flexible movement was required. 
The model was designed in such a way that it allowed for easy attachment of servo motors and the integration of fishing thread to control fin movement.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>Simulation and Motion Planning:</strong><br>
Motion capture hardware and software were utilised to study how manta rays move their fins while swimming. 
This technology helped us observe the fin motion pattern and inspired us to replicate a similar motion in our model.

We carefully studied the range of movement, flexibility, and direction of fin flaps to guide our design choices. 
These insights were essential for planning how the fins of our robotic manta ray would move using fishing thread connected to servo motors.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>Material Selection:</strong><br>
For 3D printing the model, Poly-lactic Acid (PLA) filament was selected as the primary material. 
PLA was ideal for this project because of its strength, durability, and ease of printing.

For connecting and assembling different parts like fins and body, we used pins. 
To enable fin movement, fishing thread was used to link the fins with servo motors, allowing for controlled and flexible articulation. 
The use of fishing thread provided lightweight yet strong connectivity between moving parts.
Basic electronics like servo motors were included to power the fin movement, making the model function more like a robotic concept.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>3D Printing:</strong><br>
		  <p>
After finalising the design in Onshape, the model was divided into separate parts suitable for 3D printing. The main 3D printed parts included:</p>
  <ul>
<li> The hollow main body shell
  <li> Segmented left and right pectoral fins
  <li> Tail and caudal fin with optional motion features
  <li> Internal mounting structures to support servo motors and connections
	  </ul>
We used FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) technology for printing all parts using PLA filament. 
The slicing of each part was done using Cura software, where settings were optimised based on the size, complexity, and orientation of each part to avoid print failures.    </li>
    
	  <li>
      <strong>Post-Processing and Assembly:</strong><br>
Once the 3D printing process was completed, the next phase involved post-processing the parts to ensure proper fit and finish. 
All support materials were carefully removed, and the printed surfaces were cleaned and smoothed using sanding tools.

The parts were then assembled manually. Pins were used to connect the fins to the main body, and fishing thread was attached from the servo motors to specific fin sections to enable controlled movement.
Manual adjustments and testing were done to ensure that the fins moved smoothly without friction or resistance.
    </li>
	  	  <li>
      <strong>Resin production and Surface Finishing</strong><br>
To further improve the appearance and durability of the model, resin coating techniques were applied to certain parts of the manta ray. 
Resin production helped in achieving a better surface finish, protecting the model, and adding a slight gloss to resemble the texture of real marine creatures.
    </li>
	  
    <li>
      <strong>Final Testing and Evaluation:</strong><br>
The final assembled manta ray model was tested for its visual accuracy, structural integrity, and fin movement functionality. 
	    We powered the servo motors to test the fin articulation using the fishing thread mechanism.

The model successfully demonstrated lifelike fin motion, closely mimicking the gentle and flowing movements of a real manta ray. 
	    Photographs and videos were taken to document the working prototype and development process.
    </li>
	      <li>
      <strong>Final Presentation:</strong><br>
The completed manta ray model was presented as a fully 3D printed, bio-inspired robotic prototype that combines organic design with mechanical movement. 
The project highlighted how engineering and biomimicry can work together using modern manufacturing tools like 3D scanning, motion capture, Onshape modelling, and 3D printing.

This development process not only created a visually accurate model but also showcased potential applications in underwater robotics, research, and educational demonstrations.

  <h2>Design Resources and Technologies Used</h2>
  <p>
The development of the manta ray-inspired robotic model was a multidisciplinary process, integrating advanced design tools, workshop technologies, and digital fabrication techniques. 
The objective was to create a lifelike prototype that reflected both the aesthetics and functional motion of a real manta ray. 
To achieve this, our team leveraged a wide range of resources provided through university facilities, combining scanning, modelling, simulation, printing, and post-processing techniques.
Each phase of the design and build process relied on specialised tools and methods to ensure high precision and realism. 
Below is a comprehensive overview of the key technologies and resources that contributed to the success of this project.  </p>
  <ol>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>3D Scanning Hardware, Software, and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
We began the development process by using high-resolution 3D scanning hardware and software to capture accurate anatomical references. 
Rather than working solely from images or sketches, we scanned real fish models to gather detailed surface information — especially the natural textures and contours of the skin. 
This allowed us to extract realistic features, such as the unique ripple patterns and organic curves of a manta ray, which were directly applied to our 3D model.
The scanning process was conducted in dedicated scanning environments within the university’s workshop, where proper lighting and stability helped reduce distortions and ensured reliable mesh data. The results were used not only for shape reference but also to guide the sculpting and digital design phases.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>Motion Capture Hardware, Software, and Stage Facilities:</strong><br>
To replicate the smooth, flowing motion of manta ray fins, we used motion capture technology. The system helped us study and analyse the kinematics of fin-like movements by capturing data from staged demonstrations. 
With motion capture sensors attached to simulated fin models, we were able to observe how flexible materials behaved when mimicking underwater movement.
The motion data collected from this process informed the articulation design and inspired the movement mechanism in our robotic manta ray. 
Although we didn’t use the data directly for animation, it provided valuable insights into natural motion paths and realistic movement patterns, which we applied in both the design and control planning of the final prototype.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>3D Modelling Software:ON-SHAPE:</strong><br>
For the modelling and design process, we used Onshape, a cloud-based 3D modelling platform, to digitally build the entire structure of the manta ray. 
Onshape allowed for collaborative work and flexible parametric modelling, which made it easy to test variations, refine details, and adapt designs across the team.
The manta ray body was designed as a hollow shell to reduce weight and facilitate internal mounting. 
The pectoral fins were designed as segmented extensions to enable flexibility, allowing natural-looking articulation once assembled. 
Instead of using traditional mechanical joints, the fin design was 3D printed with built-in flexibility and connected using fishing thread for motion. 
The internal structure was also modelled to support servo motor placement and to secure the connections needed for controlled movement.    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Haptic Input Hardware and 3D Sculpting Software:</strong><br>
To refine the outer shape of the manta ray and add organic realism, we utilized haptic input devices along with 3D sculpting software. 
These tools allowed us to physically "feel" and sculpt the virtual surfaces, improving accuracy in replicating natural forms like curves, bulges, and transitions between body sections.
This approach was especially useful when working on the outer body shell and fin textures, as it enabled intuitive manipulation that would have been difficult with traditional modelling tools alone. 
The tactile feedback also helped us maintain smooth surface continuity while enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the model.    </li>
    
	  <li>
      <strong>3D Printing Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
		  <p>
Once the design was finalised, we used Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D printers to fabricate the parts of the manta ray. 
PLA filament was chosen as the primary printing material due to its rigidity, ease of use, and affordability. The model was divided into printable segments, including: 
	  </p>

	<ul>
		<li>The hollow main body
		<li>Left and right segmented pectoral fins
		<li>An optional tail and caudal fin section
		<li>Internal mounts for servo motors and threading mechanisms
	</ul>
	  <p>
		Slicing and print settings were managed using Cura, where we carefully oriented each part to minimise the need for supports and to avoid print failures. 
		The university’s 3D printing workshop provided the necessary infrastructure to monitor prints, make adjustments, and iterate quickly when necessary.</p>  </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Laser Cutting Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
This method allowed us to quickly produce accurate 2D parts, which were then integrated into the 3D assembly. 
The combination of laser-cut and 3D printed parts offered a hybrid fabrication solution that was both efficient and cost-effective.    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resin Production, Post-Production, and Composite Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
To improve the finish and durability of certain parts, resin production techniques were employed. Resin was used to coat or fill small areas where smoothness and additional strength were needed, especially for parts subjected to repeated movement or tension from the fishing thread.
Post-processing included sanding, surface smoothing, and optional painting. Curing stations and manual tools helped us achieve a polished, professional finish. 
The composite workshop also allowed for exploration of hybrid materials and reinforcement methods where lightweight strength was needed, especially around fin connectors.    </li>
