								<h2 class="major">AIM OF PROJECT</h2>
								<p>The aim of this project is to design and develop a bio-inspired robotic model of a manta ray that replicates the natural form and smooth fin movements of the real-life marine creature. The main objective is to combine nature-inspired design with modern engineering techniques to create both a functional robotic prototype and a smaller toy version of a manta ray.

As a group, we began this project by brainstorming ideas and researching various marine creatures. We finalised the manta ray concept because of its unique shape, elegant movement, and potential for creative mechanical design. We started developing sketches and explored different possibilities for creating a toy manta ray with movable fins.

To achieve accuracy in design, we used 3D scanning hardware and software to capture detailed anatomical features from existing manta ray models. Motion capture technology further helped us study and understand the natural fin movement, allowing us to replicate it in our design.

The design and modelling process was carried out using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software and 3D modelling tools. Haptic input devices and sculpting software enabled us to fine-tune the complex organic structure of the manta ray with better control and precision.

Finally, we used 3D printing technology and resin production to fabricate the parts and assemble the prototype. The toy version features articulated fins designed to move naturally, serving as both an educational tool and a demonstration of biomimicry and mechanical articulation.

This project demonstrates how nature can inspire innovative engineering solutions through advanced design, motion analysis, and modern fabrication techniques.</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="major">Development Process</h2>
  <ol>
	  
    <li>
      <strong>Research and Conceptualization:</strong><br>
The development of the bio-inspired manta ray model began with an in-depth research phase, where our group explored various marine creatures for inspiration. After multiple brainstorming sessions, we finalised the idea of designing a robotic manta ray because of its unique structure, elegant body design, and fluid fin movement.

We studied the biology, structure, and natural movement patterns of real manta rays, focusing on their body proportions, fin dynamics, and swimming style. This research gave us an understanding of how manta rays glide smoothly in water using their large, flexible pectoral fins.
We created multiple hand sketches and rough design ideas to visualise the overall shape of the manta ray and identify the possible articulation points for fin movement.    </li>
	  
    <li>
      <strong>3D Scanning and Reference Collection:</strong><br>
To make the design more accurate and realistic, we used 3D scanning hardware and software available in the university facilities. 
The main purpose of using 3D scanning was to capture the fine surface details, skin textures, and curves of existing fish models. This data was extremely useful in replicating the natural skin pattern and the organic flow of the manta ray’s body.

Along with 3D scanning, we referred to multiple reference images and 3D scanned data available online to study the anatomical structure of manta rays. 
The scanned texture details were later integrated into the digital design to give a realistic finish to the final 3D printed model.    </li>
	  
    <li>
      <strong>CAD Design and Modeling:</strong><br>
Once the research and data collection phase was completed, we moved on to the digital modelling process. Onshape, a cloud-based 3D modelling software, was used to create the manta ray model. The entire model was designed in multiple segments to ensure that the fins could move naturally when assembled.

Instead of traditional CAD software like Fusion 360, Onshape provided flexibility in creating and refining the model collaboratively. 
We focused on designing a hollow main body for lightweight construction, with segmented left and right pectoral fins that could simulate the flapping motion of a real manta ray.
Special attention was given to designing the fin sections, where flexible movement was required. 
The model was designed in such a way that it allowed for easy attachment of servo motors and the integration of fishing thread to control fin movement.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>Simulation and Motion Planning:</strong><br>
Motion capture hardware and software were utilised to study how manta rays move their fins while swimming. 
This technology helped us observe the fin motion pattern and inspired us to replicate a similar motion in our model.

We carefully studied the range of movement, flexibility, and direction of fin flaps to guide our design choices. 
These insights were essential for planning how the fins of our robotic manta ray would move using fishing thread connected to servo motors.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>Material Selection:</strong><br>
For 3D printing the model, Poly-lactic Acid (PLA) filament was selected as the primary material. 
PLA was ideal for this project because of its strength, durability, and ease of printing.

For connecting and assembling different parts like fins and body, we used pins. 
To enable fin movement, fishing thread was used to link the fins with servo motors, allowing for controlled and flexible articulation. 
The use of fishing thread provided lightweight yet strong connectivity between moving parts.
Basic electronics like servo motors were included to power the fin movement, making the model function more like a robotic concept.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>3D Printing:</strong><br>
		  <p>
After finalising the design in Onshape, the model was divided into separate parts suitable for 3D printing. The main 3D printed parts included:</p>
  <ul>
<li> The hollow main body shell
  <li> Segmented left and right pectoral fins
  <li> Tail and caudal fin with optional motion features
  <li> Internal mounting structures to support servo motors and connections
	  </ul>
We used FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) technology for printing all parts using PLA filament. 
The slicing of each part was done using Cura software, where settings were optimised based on the size, complexity, and orientation of each part to avoid print failures.    </li>
    
	  <li>
      <strong>Post-Processing and Assembly:</strong><br>
      After printing, supports were removed and the surfaces were cleaned using sanding tools. The parts were assembled using pins and joints designed into the CAD model. The articulation was tested and adjusted for smoother motion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Final Testing and Presentation:</strong><br>
      The assembled manta ray model was evaluated for its visual resemblance and mechanical motion. Demonstration videos and photographs were taken to document the process. The final prototype was showcased as both a functional toy and a robotic concept model.

  <h2>Design Resources and Technologies Used</h2>
  <p>
    The design and fabrication of the manta ray-inspired robotic model utilized a wide range of advanced digital and physical tools, workshop facilities, and prototyping technologies. Each stage of the design process was supported by specialized equipment and software to ensure precision, creativity, and functionality in the final output. Below is an overview of the key resources involved:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>3D Scanning Hardware, Software, and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
      High-resolution 3D scanning equipment was employed to capture reference shapes and textures from natural or modeled forms. The scanning process helped guide the anatomical accuracy of the manta ray's body structure. Dedicated scanning workspaces ensured proper lighting and stability for accurate model acquisition.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Motion Capture Hardware, Software, and Stage Facilities:</strong><br>
      Motion capture technology was used to study and replicate the fluid movements of manta ray fins. A motion capture stage setup allowed for the recording of fin-like movements, which were later mapped into the digital model to assist in simulating and designing articulated motion in the fins.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Software Package:</strong><br>
      Fusion 360 was utilized for creating detailed mechanical designs of the manta ray model. This included segmenting the fins for movement, planning joints and pin holes, and validating tolerances for 3D printed assembly. The CAD environment allowed for parametric modeling and simulation of the final structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3D Modelling Software:</strong><br>
      In addition to CAD, organic modeling tools were used to sculpt the outer body for aesthetic and biomimetic realism. This supported the creation of a smooth and flowing manta ray shape, closely mimicking natural forms beyond purely mechanical components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Haptic Input Hardware and 3D Sculpting Software:</strong><br>
      Haptic feedback tools were used to interactively sculpt portions of the manta ray’s outer skin, enabling more intuitive and tactile control over digital shaping. This approach allowed for enhanced surface detailing and ergonomic refinement in the body design.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3D Printing Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
      Multiple components of the model were fabricated using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers. PLA was primarily used due to its accessibility and rigidity, with workshop facilities providing support for multi-material printing, surface finishing, and part testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Laser Cutting Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
      For internal frame structures or precise mounting plates, laser cutting was employed on acrylic or wood sheets. Laser-cutting helped produce accurate 2D profiles that supported the assembly of more complex 3D components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resin Production, Post-Production, and Composite Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
      Where high-detail or smooth finishes were required (such as skin overlays or ornamental features), resin-based techniques were explored. Post-processing stations allowed for curing, sanding, and painting of resin parts. Additionally, composite workshops offered opportunities to explore hybrid structures and reinforce delicate joints.
