								<h2 class="major">AIM OF PROJECT</h2>
								<p>The aim of this project is to design and develop a bio-inspired robotic model of a manta ray that replicates the natural form and smooth fin movements of the real-life marine creature. The main objective is to combine nature-inspired design with modern engineering techniques to create both a functional robotic prototype and a smaller toy version of a manta ray.

As a group, we began this project by brainstorming ideas and researching various marine creatures. We finalised the manta ray concept because of its unique shape, elegant movement, and potential for creative mechanical design. We started developing sketches and explored different possibilities for creating a toy manta ray with movable fins.

To achieve accuracy in design, we used 3D scanning hardware and software to capture detailed anatomical features from existing manta ray models. Motion capture technology further helped us study and understand the natural fin movement, allowing us to replicate it in our design.

The design and modelling process was carried out using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software and 3D modelling tools. Haptic input devices and sculpting software enabled us to fine-tune the complex organic structure of the manta ray with better control and precision.

Finally, we used 3D printing technology and resin production to fabricate the parts and assemble the prototype. The toy version features articulated fins designed to move naturally, serving as both an educational tool and a demonstration of biomimicry and mechanical articulation.

This project demonstrates how nature can inspire innovative engineering solutions through advanced design, motion analysis, and modern fabrication techniques.</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="major">Development Process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Research and Conceptualization:</strong><br>
      The project began with extensive research into the biology, movement, and structure of real manta rays. This included studying fin motion, body proportions, and underwater dynamics. Sketches and rough models were created to explore the overall shape and articulation points.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3D Scanning and Reference Collection:</strong><br>
      For anatomical accuracy, reference images and 3D scans (where available) were analyzed to better understand the curvature and surface details of the manta ray's body and fins. This helped in guiding the CAD modeling phase.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CAD Design and Modeling:</strong><br>
      Using Fusion 360, the manta ray model was created in multiple segments to allow for articulation, especially in the fins. The design incorporated joints and connection points that would allow motion, either mechanically or via motorized control for future upgrades.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Simulation and Motion Planning:</strong><br>
      Basic motion simulations were run within Fusion 360 to verify the range of movement for the fins and ensure smooth mechanical interaction. Design iterations were carried out to minimize friction and optimize motion paths.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Material Selection:</strong><br>
      PLA was selected as the primary material due to its rigidity and ease of printing. TPU was considered for the fins to allow flexibility, depending on the specific part function. Threaded rods and connectors were planned for assembling moving parts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3D Printing:</strong><br>
      The model was split into separate printable parts: the main body, left and right fins, and optional tail section. Each part was sliced using appropriate settings in Cura for PLA. Supports and orientation were carefully managed to reduce print failures.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Post-Processing and Assembly:</strong><br>
      After printing, supports were removed and the surfaces were cleaned using sanding tools. The parts were assembled using pins and joints designed into the CAD model. The articulation was tested and adjusted for smoother motion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Final Testing and Presentation:</strong><br>
      The assembled manta ray model was evaluated for its visual resemblance and mechanical motion. Demonstration videos and photographs were taken to document the process. The final prototype was showcased as both a functional toy and a robotic concept model.

  <h2>Design Resources and Technologies Used</h2>
  <p>
    The design and fabrication of the manta ray-inspired robotic model utilized a wide range of advanced digital and physical tools, workshop facilities, and prototyping technologies. Each stage of the design process was supported by specialized equipment and software to ensure precision, creativity, and functionality in the final output. Below is an overview of the key resources involved:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>3D Scanning Hardware, Software, and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
      High-resolution 3D scanning equipment was employed to capture reference shapes and textures from natural or modeled forms. The scanning process helped guide the anatomical accuracy of the manta ray's body structure. Dedicated scanning workspaces ensured proper lighting and stability for accurate model acquisition.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Motion Capture Hardware, Software, and Stage Facilities:</strong><br>
      Motion capture technology was used to study and replicate the fluid movements of manta ray fins. A motion capture stage setup allowed for the recording of fin-like movements, which were later mapped into the digital model to assist in simulating and designing articulated motion in the fins.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Software Package:</strong><br>
      Fusion 360 was utilized for creating detailed mechanical designs of the manta ray model. This included segmenting the fins for movement, planning joints and pin holes, and validating tolerances for 3D printed assembly. The CAD environment allowed for parametric modeling and simulation of the final structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3D Modelling Software:</strong><br>
      In addition to CAD, organic modeling tools were used to sculpt the outer body for aesthetic and biomimetic realism. This supported the creation of a smooth and flowing manta ray shape, closely mimicking natural forms beyond purely mechanical components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Haptic Input Hardware and 3D Sculpting Software:</strong><br>
      Haptic feedback tools were used to interactively sculpt portions of the manta ray’s outer skin, enabling more intuitive and tactile control over digital shaping. This approach allowed for enhanced surface detailing and ergonomic refinement in the body design.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3D Printing Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
      Multiple components of the model were fabricated using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers. PLA was primarily used due to its accessibility and rigidity, with workshop facilities providing support for multi-material printing, surface finishing, and part testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Laser Cutting Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
      For internal frame structures or precise mounting plates, laser cutting was employed on acrylic or wood sheets. Laser-cutting helped produce accurate 2D profiles that supported the assembly of more complex 3D components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resin Production, Post-Production, and Composite Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
      Where high-detail or smooth finishes were required (such as skin overlays or ornamental features), resin-based techniques were explored. Post-processing stations allowed for curing, sanding, and painting of resin parts. Additionally, composite workshops offered opportunities to explore hybrid structures and reinforce delicate joints.
